= VM Management with Ansible Automation Platform and Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization

== Lab Overview
In this hands-on lab, you will learn how to manage the lifecycle of your virtual
machines (VMs) using Ansible and the Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization
collection. You will focus on essential VM operations, including starting,
stopping, and restarting virtual machines.

By the end of this lab, you will have the foundational skills to apply these
techniques in your own environments, setting the stage for broader automation
initiatives. These include tasks like performing system updates and optimizing
resource utilization, which will be explored in subsequent exercises.

== Lab Setup

. Pre-Configured Items:
* The Ansible Automation Platform controller is already set up.
* The required Execution Environment (`Day2 EE`) has been pre-created with the `redhat.openshift` and `redhat.openshift_virtualization` collections.
* Necessary credentials to access the Virtual Machines are pre-configured in the AAP controller.
* All VMs are running at the start of the lab.

. Lab files to be created/updated::
* `tasks/main.yml`: For calling the appropriate stop, start, and restart tasks.
* `tasks/stop_vm.yml`: For stopping the VM.
* `tasks/start_vm.yml`: For starting the VM.
* `tasks/restart_vm.yml`: For restarting the VM.
* `vm-management.yml`: A playbook to run the tasks.

== Lab Steps

=== Test Connectivity of the Virtual Machines

In this lab, there will be three virtual machines running within your
OpenShift environment. To confirm they are running, navigate to the following
using the OpenShift UI dashboard:

Virtualization -> VirtualMachines within the `vms-aap-day2` project.

//TODO add image created dec 2

With the VMs now confirmed as up and running, ensure that you can ping those VMs
within the AAP dashboard as follows:

. Login to the AAP Dashboard
+
. Navigate to Automation Execution -> Infrastructure -> Inventories
   * Select the `OpenShift Virtual Machines` Inventory
   * Within the Details page of the `OpenShift Virtual Machines` Inventory, select the *Hosts* tab.
+
. Select the 3 VMs and click the *Run command* button
   * Within the Run command Details, select the `ping` module and click *Next*.
   * Within the Run command Execution Environment, Select the *TODO execution environment* and click *Next*.
   * Within the Run command Credential, select the *Workshop Credential* and click *Next*.
   * Within the Run command Review, select *Finish*.
+
. Verify Results: You should see a list of VMs along with their statuses similar to: TODO
+
----
vms-aap-day2-rhel9-vm1 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
vms-aap-day2-rhel9-vm2 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
vms-aap-day2-rhel9-vm3 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
----

=== Update the `tasks/main.yml` file

In this lab, you'll work with a `redhatone.vm_management` collection stored in
your Gitea `virt-aap-day2` repository. This collection includes a
`vm_management` role, which you will use to create tasks for starting, stopping,
and restarting a virtual machine.

Before creating these tasks, you will update the `main.yml` file within the
`vm_management` role to invoke the appropriate task based on the action value
defined in the Ansible playbook that you will create later. This setup allows a
single playbook to handle all three VM management tasks dynamically, depending
on the specified action.

. Within your VSCode editor or terminal, change the directory to:
+
----
$ cd collections/ansible_collections/redhatone/vm_management/roles/vm_management/tasks/
----
+
. Open the `main.yml` file and edit as follows:
+
----
---
# tasks file for vm_management

- name: Run the specific vm_management task
  include_tasks: "{{ task_file }}"
----

=== Create the Ansible VM Management Playbook

This Ansible playbook dynamically calls the role and executes the appropriate
task based on the `task_file` variable given.

. Navigate to your `virt-aap-day2` directory
+
----
$ cd /home/lab-user/virt-aap-day2
----
+
. Create a manage_vm_playbook.yml file
+
----
$ touch manage_vm_playbook.yml
----
+
. Using your favorite editor, create the following Ansible Playbook:
+
----
---
- name: Manage a Virtual Machine
  hosts: localhost
  vars:
    vm_name: rhel9-vm1
    vm_namespace: vms-aap-day2
    task_file: stop_vm.yml # Expected values: stop_vm.yml, start_vm.yml, restart_vm.yml
  roles:
    - redhatone.vm_management.vm_management
----

=== Stop a VM Task

Create a task to wait until a virtual machine (VM) is stopped. This task will be
included in the `vm_management` role, specifically under the `tasks` directory,
in a file named `stop_vm.yml`. Later in the lab, you will call this task from an
Ansible playbook to demonstrate its capability.

. Navigate to the Tasks Directory:
+
  * Inside your `vm_management` role directory, go to the `tasks` folder:
+
----
$ cd collections/ansible_collections/redhatone/vm_management/roles/vm_management/tasks/
----
+
. Create the `stop_vm.yml` file
+
----
touch stop_vm.yml
----
+
. Open the `stop_vm.yml` file with your favorite editor and add the following task
+
----
---
- name: Wait until the VirtualMachine is stopped
  redhat.openshift_virtualization.kubevirt_vm:
    name: "{{ vm_name }}"
    namespace: "{{ vm_namespace }}"
    running: false
    wait: true
----
+
Explanation of the Task:
+
  * The `kubevirt_vm` module that is part of the `redhat.openshift_virtualization` collection is used to modify a VM
  * The `name` parameter uses a user defined variable named `vm_name` to specify  which VM to stop
  * The `running: false` ensures the VM is not running
  * The `wait: true` ensures the next Ansible task isn't triggered until the stop is complete

=== Create & Run a Job Template with Ansible Automation Platform

In order to run the `manage_vm_playbook.yml` within Ansible Automation Platform,
create a Job Template to run the automation as follows:

. Go to **Automation Execution â†’ Templates**, click the **Create template** button, and choose **Create job template**.
+
. Fill out the following details:
+
|===
| Parameter                  | Value

| Name                       | Stop VMs
| Job Type                   | Run
| Inventory                  | OpenShift Virtual Machines
| Project                    | Workshop Project
| Playbook                   | `manage_vm_playbook.yml`
| Execution Environment      | Day2 EE
| Credentials                | OpenShift Credential, Workshop Credential
|===
+
. Click **Create job template**.
+
. Once the Stop VMs Job Template is created, select the `Launch Template` button
on the top right corner to run the job.

//TODO add image created on dec 3

==== Bonus Section: Extending `stop_vm.yml` to Handle All VMs in a Namespace

While the ability to manage a specific VM is important, the real value of
automation lies in managing multiple VMs at scale. In this bonus section, you'll
extend the functionality of the `stop_vm.yml` task file to handle all the
Virtual Machines that reside within the `vms-aap-day2` namespace and learn how
to use the debug task to understand the structure of the VM resource `vm_info`
to identify key fields required to create dynamic Ansible tasks.

. Access the `stop_vm.yml` file using your favorite editor
+
----
$ cd collections/ansible_collections/redhatone/vm_management/roles/vm_management/tasks/
----
+
. Modify the existing `stop_vm.yml` content with the following:
+
----
---
- name: Get all VirtualMachines in the namespace
  redhat.openshift_virtualization.kubevirt_vm_info:
    namespace: "{{ vm_namespace }}"
  register: vm_info

- name: Debug the vm_info variable
  ansible.builtin.debug:
    var: vm_info

- name: Wait until the VirtualMachine is stopped
  redhat.openshift_virtualization.kubevirt_vm:
    name: "{{ item.metadata.name }}"
    namespace: "{{ item.metadata.namespace }}"
    running: false
    wait: true
  loop: "{{ vm_info.resources }}"
  when: item.status.printableStatus != "Stopped"
----
+
Explanation of Key Fields:
+
* `metadata.name`: The name of the VirtualMachine.
* `metadata.namespace`: The namespace the VM belongs to.
* `status.printableStatus`: The current status of the VM (e.g., Stopped).
+
These key fields originate from the `vm_info` structure output provided by the
`ansible.builtin.debug` module. The structure looks as follows and is
abbreviated for easier viewing below.
+
----
changed: true
result:
  apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1
  kind: VirtualMachine
  metadata:
    annotations:
      kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration: >
        ...
    ...
    name: rhel9-vm1
    namespace: vms-aap-day2
  spec:
    ...
  status:
    ...
    printableStatus: Stopped
  ...
----
+
. Access the `manage_vm_playbook.yml` file using your favorite editor
+
----
$ cd ~/virt-aap-day2
----
+
. Modify the existing `manage_vm_playbook.yml` by commenting the following:
+
----
# vm_name: rhel9-vm1
----
+
. Head back to the AAP Dashboard UI, go to the **Automation Execution -> Templates**, select the `Stop VMs` Job Template and re-run via the `Launch Template` button.

=== Start VM Task

=== Lab Exercise: Start Multiple VMs

In this lab exercise, you will build on your knowledge of managing multiple VMs
by creating a task to start your VMs within the `vm_management` role. This task
will be added to the tasks directory in a file named `start_vm.yml`.

The following steps will guide you in creating the `start_vm.yml` file.

. Inside your `vm_management` role directory, go to the `tasks` folder:
+
----
$ cd collections/ansible_collections/redhatone/vm_management/roles/vm_management/tasks/
----
+
. Create the `start_vm.yml` file
+
----
$ touch start_vm.yml
----
+
. Open the `start_vm.yml` file with your favorite editor and add the following task:
+
----
---
- name: Get all VirtualMachines in the namespace
  redhat.openshift_virtualization.kubevirt_vm_info:
    namespace: "{{ vm_namespace }}"
  register: vm_info

== Conclusion

Congratulations on completing the lab!

In this lab, you explored how to effectively manage the lifecycle of virtual
machines using Ansible Automation Platform and the Red Hat OpenShift
Virtualization collection. By working through tasks to start, stop, and restart
VMs, you gained practical experience in leveraging automation to manage VMs at
scale.

By the end of this lab, you should now understand:

* How to dynamically retrieve and process VM information using the `ansible.builtin.debug` module
* How to modify a collection and role for starting, stopping, and restarting VMs.
* How to integrate the `redhatone.vm_managemenet` collection into an Ansible playbook and run it using the Ansible Automation Platform.

These foundational skills set the stage for further automation, enabling you to
automate new tasks  and optimize resource usage in your environment. In
subsequent labs, you'll build on this knowledge to tackle other re-world
scenarios, such as system updates and disaster recovery
planning.

Your ability to automate routine VM management tasks not only saves time but
also minimizes human error, ensuring consistency and reliability in your
virtualized infrastructure.

Well done, and keep experimenting with new ways to
